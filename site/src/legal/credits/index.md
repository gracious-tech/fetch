fetch(bible) wouldn't be possible without the extensive hard work of many organisations and individuals, first and foremost the Bible translators of all the versions available.

__Of special note:__
 * [eBible](https://ebible.org/) is the source for most of our translations and we'd have very few without their work
 * [BibleMultiConverter](https://github.com/schierlm/BibleMultiConverter) helps greatly in converting translations to the formats we need
 * [The Digital Bible Society](https://dbs.org/) greatly assisted in the conversion of texts to HTML
 * [OpenBible.info](https://www.openbible.info/) cross-reference data collected from the _Treasury of Scripture Knowledge_ is used to create our own filtered version
 * [Tyndale House Publishers](https://tyndaleopenresources.com/) provides our main source of study notes
 * [Missional Digerati](https://missionaldigerati.org/) developed several features of the platform

This project also makes use of numerous open source packages that can be identified in the source code.

Lastly and most importantly, glory to God for his Word to us!
