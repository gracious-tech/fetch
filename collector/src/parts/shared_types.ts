    These are designed to aid automated selection/elimination of translations for most use cases
        but are not exhaustive and users will still need to take responsibility themselves for
        appropriately using/not using translations.

    If there are complex interactions between conditions
        e.g. Verse limitations apply to commercial use but not other uses
        Then create multiple custom licenses to account for the various possibilities

    Not all conditions are included
        For example some translations forbid unchristian use
            e.g. https://ebible.org/Scriptures/details.php?id=ukr1996
        But such conditions are too vague and varied to usefully categorise and this service is
        already expected to be almost exclusively used by mainline Christians.
        If a condition _is_ "likely" to affect users then the `forbid_other` should be true.
