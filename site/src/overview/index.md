# What is fetch(bible)?

 * __An initiative__ for making digital access to the Bible easier and more efficient
 * __A collection__ of all the Bible translations in the world that we can get our hands on
 * __A service__ for free unlimited unrestricted access to hosted Bible content
 * __A tool__ for integrating the Bible into apps and websites with minimal effort


## What can you do with fetch(bible)?

You can integrate scripture into any website or app, with some examples being:

 * [The fetch(bible) app](https://app.fetch.bible/)
 * [Track Bible](https://track.bible)


## Who made fetch(bible)?

[Gracious Tech](https://gracious.tech) created and maintains fetch(bible), and we believe _"All Scripture is God-breathed"_ (2 Timothy 3:16) and essential for everyone to have unrestricted access to.

Though our work was only possible thanks to the [extensive efforts of others](/legal/credits/) who have been translating, collecting, and working on tools that fetch(bible) makes use of.
